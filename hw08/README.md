## HW08 - Logging Data into the Cloud
## Completed by: Noah Lee
Continuing off my progress in reading the MAX31820s through python, it was relatively straightfoward to logging temperature data to a google sheets. \
Once the credentials.json and token.json were handled, I modified the demo.py from the exercises repo to read and log temperature data every 15 seconds. \

The image below shows it resting at ambient until I put my finger on two of the sensors.
